# Polysomnography Datasets for Automatic Sleep Stage Scoring

The following is a list of freely available sleep datasets with overnight sleep recordings obtained using polysomnography and can be used to develop algorithms for automatic sleep scoring.

## Sleep-EDF Database Expanded

**Number of recordings:** 197  
**Scoring method:** R&K  
**Description:** This database consists of overnight PSG recordings from two different studies. It contains EEG from Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz chabbeks, EOG (horizontal), and submental chin EMG.

## Sleep-EDF Database

**Number of recordings:** 8  
**Scoring method:** R&K  
**Description:** This is a subset of the Sleep-EDF Expanded Database. Initially, this was the only sleep database available but has now been made obsolete with the availability of the larger database.
